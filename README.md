## Interview Application Instructions

This project is a barebones version of our production application. It is a basic web page that calls a mock API and displays images from said request. At a minimum, we will be reviewing this code during your technical interview. We recommend interested applicants fork this repository and improve it in any way they see fit. You can find a list of recommended tasks below that closely mimic current Kuva projects. We understand that applicants are busy and have their own work to prioritize, so it is not necessary that you complete all the tasks. That being said, finishing at least one of them will give you a feel for the work we do!

Have fun with it! If you find a bug, dislike the UX, or are frustrated by the file structure, change it! This should be a fun way of showcasing your frontend interests and skills.

### Running the Project

#### `npm start`

This command concurrently runs the app on port 3000 & a jsonserver on port 7071.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

More information about available scripts can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### JSON Server

This project mimics our production application APIs using the json-server package. The mock server runs on port 7071.\
The json files contain a list of organizations (e.g. Kuva clients), a list of available cameras, and a list of gas events (this includes a _scanresults_ object: an array of images and their associated metadata). You can read and write to the json files using standard HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The project currently uses Axios to handle HTTP requests.

More information about the server is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).\
More information about our HTTP client is is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axiosr).

### Recommended Tasks

#### Right & Left Arrow Buttons

There is currently no way of moving from one image in the list to the next!

#### Filter Images

Once you're able to scroll through available scans, it may be useful to filter out images that have no gas detections. Each image should have a _detectionList_ field in its metadata. A simple toggle should do the trick!

#### Display Image Metadata

Each scan has certain metadata associated with it. Examples include confidence levels (_overallConf_) and noise floor levels (_noiseFloorMetric_). Similarly, images with detections (_detectionsList_) will have metadata associated with those detections. None of this information is currently being displayed.

#### Add Detection Boxes

If an image has a "detection" (gas identified by our internal algorithms), than the detection (found in _detectionsList_) will have a list of coordinates called _roicoordsList_. These are the coordinates of our "_Regions of Interest_": red boxes we draw on the image to indicate where exactly the detection was found. Draw the boxes on the image based on the coordinates provided.

#### Navigation Bar

The site is currently only one page! It would be nice to have a functional navigation bar that lets you see other pages (e.g. Account, Settings).\
Basic page routing can be done with [react router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

#### Switch Selected Cameras

The jsonserver has a list of available cameras. It would be helpful to get that list in the frontend, and allow the user to select which camera they would like to see.

#### Redux/Context

As our projects get larger and more complex, it becomes harder to manage our application's state and make certain variables widely available. Certain tools simplify the process. Redux and React _Contexts_ are two such tools. Implement either in the best way you see fit.

More information about Redux can be found [here](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started).\
More information about React Context can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
